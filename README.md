# ☕ Coffee Timer

A modern, minimalistic **coffee cup timer for productivity**.  
Instead of a regular countdown, the timer is visualized as a coffee cup that slowly empties over your chosen focus session.  

The app also includes **basic analytics** — tracking your session history, showing daily usage in bar charts, and weekly productivity comparisons.
